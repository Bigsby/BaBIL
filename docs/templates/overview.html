<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Microsoft, like any other group of one or more persons, has made many "mistakes" (only if you don't learn from them) through out its history. .Net (Framework) was, for sure, not one of them. The dream of a standardized ecosystem (runtime) for all Microsoft
    (Windows, to start with) things is a good one. The
    <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">Wikipedia page</url> about the .Net Framewok, tells the story that is not the purpose here. But let's put some definition in place...</p>

<h2>What is .Net?</h2>
<p>A software framework that allows creating software, with a single code base from a myriad of languages, interoperability between languages and that run in diferent environments. In the end, it consists of a runtime (or runtimes), called <b>Common Language
    Runtime</b> (<b>CLR</b>, from now on) that excutes a intermediate language (<b>IL</b>, from now on) <em>byte-code</em>, called <b>Common Intermediate
    Language</b> (<b>CIL</b>, from now on and formerly called Microsoft Intermediate Language, MSIL), that is the result of compiling the actual written code. CLR also provides a set of core libraries that cater for common software needs, e.g., File System
    operations, Networking, etc.</p>
<p>This framework provides an abstraction layer that allows for the same <em>byte-code</em> to run on different environemnts. At first, different (almost all) versions of Microsoft's own <b>Windows</b> operating system but, these days through
    <url href="https://dot.net/core"><b>.Net Core</b></url>, on (almost) every operating system, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Microsft's' Windows:
        <ul>
            <li>Windows (desktop)</li>
            <li>Window Mobile</li>
            <li>Windows IoT</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Linux distros:
        <ul>
            <li>Debian</li>
            <li>Ubuntu</li>
            <li>Fedora</li>
            <li>Red Hat</li>
            <li>openSUSE</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Apple's macOS</li>
    <li>With
        <url href="https://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</url> (via the
        <url href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono Project</url>):
        <ul>
            <li>Google's Android</li>
            <li>Apple's iOS</li>
            <li>Samsung's Tizen</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>...that is, covering almost every <em>living</em> operating system and device. There is an
    <url href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/3977">open issue on <b>GitHub</b></url> for full support on ARM processors.</p>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Although there are .Net compilers for many languages, i.e., compilers that compile a language to <b>CIL</b> <em>byte-code</em> (e.g.,
    <url href="http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/readme.html">Phython for .Net</url>, the defunct
    <url href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7xsxf8e2(v=vs.80).aspx">Visual J#</url>, etc.), Microsoft directly maintains the compiler for these languages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>CIL</b></li>
    <li><b>C#</b></li>
    <li><b>F#</b></li>
    <li><b>VB.Net</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The intent of these series is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>deep dive into what <b>.Net</b> <em>really</em> is under the covers;</li>
    <li>what are the diferences between the languages, not in terms of semantics or syntax but in terms of:
        <ul>
            <li>What the language compiler does (and does not) for you;</li>
            <li>limitations and constraints;</li>
            <li>their <b>CIL</b> consequences with its auto-generated <em>clutter</em>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Language interoperability.</li>
</ul>
