<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Microsoft, like any other group of one or more persons, has made many "mistakes" (only if you don't learn from them) through
    out its history. .Net (Framework) was, for sure, not one of them. The dream of a standardized ecosystem (runtime) for
    all Microsoft (Windows, to start with) things is a good one. The
    <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework">Wikipedia page</a> about the .Net Framewok, tells
    the story that is not the purpose here. But let's put some definitions in place...</p>

<h2>What is .Net?</h2>
<p>A software framework that allows creating software, with a single code base from a myriad of languages and interoperability
    between languages and that run in diferent environments. In the end, it consists of a runtime, called Common Language
    Runtime (CLR, from now on) that excutes a byte code or intermediate language (IL, from now on), called Microsoft Intermediate
    Language (MSIL, from now on), that is the result of compiling the actual written code. CLR also provides a set of core
    libraries that cater for common software needs, e.g., File System operations, Networking, etc.</p>

<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<p>Although there are .Net compilers for many languages, i.e., compilers that compile a language to <b>MSIL</b> (e.g.,
    <a target="_blank" href="http://pythonnet.sourceforge.net/readme.html">Phython for .Net</a>, the defunct
    <a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7xsxf8e2(v=vs.80).aspx">Visual J#</a>, etc.), Microsoft
    directly maintains the compiler for 4 languages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>ILAsm</b></li>
    <li><b>C#</b></li>
    <li><b>VB.Net</b></li>
    <li><b>F#</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, we will focus on these languages and their native compilation consequence, i.e., <b>MSIL</b>.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The intent is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>deep dive into what <b>.Net</b> <em>really</em> is under the covers;</li>
    <li>what are the diferences between the languages, not in terms of semantics or syntax but in terms of:
        <ul>
            <li>What the language compiler does (and does not) for you;</li>
            <li>limitations and constraints;</li>
            <li>their <b>MSIL</b> consequences.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Language interoperability.</li>
</ul>
