<h1>Disasseble &amp; CIL</h1>

<p>If it is always possible to back-engineer any program run by a commonly used and standardized operating system like <b>Windows</b>    with a commonly used and standardized CPU architecture like <b>x86</b>, it most certainly is possbile to back-engineer
    commonly used and standardized byte-code like <b>CIL</b>.</p>

<p>To do so, and independent of the originally coded language, one just needs to run a simple command in the <em>Developer Command Prompt</em>:</p>
<code-highlight language="base">ildasm hello.exe /out=hello.il</code-highlight>

<p>If the <code>/out</code> parameter is excluded, a GUI application is opened, that, besides the CIL code, provides some interesting
    statistics and several information about the executable file.</p>

<p>The choice of <em>.il</em> as the file extension is not innocent. In fact, regardless of the originally coded language, the
    resulting <em>hello.il</em> file can be re-compiled using <em>ilasm</em> in the <em>Developer Command Prompt</em> like
    any <b>ILAsm</b> file as demonstrated in the <a url="hello">earlier step in these series</a>.</p>

<p>The result of disassembling the resulting <em>hello.exe</em> files is shown at the end of this page just for early reference. It will be analysed next.</p>

<h2>CIL</h2>
<p><b>CIL</b> or <b>ILAsm</b> or, as formerly known, <b>MSIL</b> is a human readably representation of .Net's <em>byte-code</em>. It's <em>kind of</em> Assembler without registers, and the likes, and with object oriented stuff.</p>
