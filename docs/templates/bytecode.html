<h1>Byte-code</h1>
<p>The <em>Hello, World!</em> program, created in the <a ui-sref="hello">previous step</a>, might look like a simple <em>ol'</em> Win32
    Application, it is, but only, to a certain extent. For instance, if these resulting <em>hello.exe</em> executable files
    were to be run on a computer where .Net Framework is not installed, an error would state that exact fact. These files
    contain a CLR header that makes them run under the CLR virtual machine. The CLR, then, reads the CIL byte-code contained
    in
    <em>hello.exe</em> file and executes it.</p>

<h2>Differences</h2>
<p>Although the <em>Hello, World!</em> program has the same purpose and the same desired and actual output, in all the languages,
    the results of each compilation is quite different. Just by looking at the size of the result <em>hello.exe</em> executable
    file, one can tell there are differences.</p>

<p>Sizes are in bytes and just sample results.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for these differences. They will be analysed further ahead...thoroughly.</p>
