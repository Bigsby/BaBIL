<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Here is what is needed to follow these series</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>A computer running <b>Windows 7</b> (or higher).</p>

<h3>Compilers ...</h3>
<p>Install any edition of <b>Visual Studio</b> 2015 or 2017. I'm not sure earlier versions of Visual Studio will work and I
    won't check.</p>
<p><b>Visual Studio</b> can be downloaded and installed from the <a target="_black" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">official website</a>.</p>

<h3>IDE</h3>
<p>Although Visual Studio <em>is</em> an <b>IDE</b>, it's too heavy and does too much and, in the way <em>hides</em> some of
    the things that allow the <em>real</em> understanding of .Net. For that, a <em>simpler</em> IDE is recommended. For the
    to-the-point, balance between simplicity, code highlighting and intellisense, I choose <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.</p>
