<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>Here is what is needed to follow these series.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>A computer running <b>Windows 7 SP1</b> (or higher).</p>

<h3>Compilers ...</h3>
<p>Any edition of Visual Studio comes with the copilers for these languages. Install any edition of <b>Visual Studio</b> 2015 or 2017 and make sure to add the components relative to languages.</p>
<p><b>Visual Studio</b> can be downloaded and installed from the <url href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">official website</url>.</p>

<h3>IDE</h3>
<p>Although Visual Studio <em>is</em> an Integrated Development Environment (from now on, <b>IDE</b>), it's too heavy and does too much and, in the way <em>hides</em> some of
    the things that allow the <em>real</em> understanding of .Net. For that, a <em>simpler</em> IDE is recommended. For the
    to-the-point, balance between simplicity, code highlighting and intellisense, I choose <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.</p>
